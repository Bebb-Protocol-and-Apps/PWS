For development and testing, additional stages have been created, i.e. canisters live on the mainnet.

Process to create another stage:
Initial reference: https://medium.com/@Catalyze.One/working-with-environments-on-the-internet-computer-59ed3d2a5763
Go to https://nns.ic0.app/ and log in
From the burger menu, choose My Canisters
Click on Create Canister and follow the creation flow (note that you need ICP to pay for the creation and charge the canister with cycles), you may start with 2-3T cycles (and can top up later)
Click on the new canister and then on Add Controller
Go to your local CLI and run: dfx identity get-principal
Copy the principal returned and paste it into the Add Controller field on the nns app, continue and confirm
Copy the id of the new canister
Paste the canister's id in the file canister_ids.json (under the new entry for the stage, the entry's ket needs to match the network name given in dfx.json) 
Create a new networks entry in dfx.json (with the network's name being the same key as given in canister_ids.json)
If there are multiple canisters for a stage, create as many canisters as needed (e.g. PersonalWebSpace_backend and PersonalWebSpace_frontend)
Add the CLI command/s in Readme for the new stage (with the correct network name)
Make sure that all code relevant for stages/networks has been changed (e.g. search for network and check all relevant results in the project files)
Run the new CLI command/s in Readme and make sure everything works as expected (just just deploy the new canister/s)
If you have any other projects depending on the canisters or that the canisters depend on, make sure to handle this accordingly (e.g. Bebb Protocol canisters: create a corresponding stage canister there and deploy it, make sure the canisters here reference that canister then for the correct stage, e.g. in dfx.json and look for Different Stages in motoko files)
