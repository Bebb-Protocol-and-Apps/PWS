# Open Internet Metaverse User Guide

## Thank you for using our app!

## What can you do with it?
### Before you log in
- Get a quick introduction to the Open Internet Metaverse (OIM) app on the Landing page
- Explore a few random Webspaces (3D Webpages) owned by OIM users on the “Explore” tab. If you like, you can also visit them (in a new tab) to get a better impression of what a Webspace is and to discover what the user displays in that particular one.
- Play around with different Webspaces you could create on the “Create” tab
  - Note that you need to log in to actually create the Webspace
  - You can preview how the Webspace would look once created
  - To do so, get familiar with the Webspaces we designed for you (e.g. space-themed “Your Web Space Station”, nature-themed “Your Nature Retreat” and island-themed “Your Internet Island”) which are ready for you to create right away and make them your personal Webspace
  - If you like to start with an existing 3D model, then we’ve got you covered
    - You can preview a Webspace with a 3D model you have on your device (just click on “Choose File” to select the 3D model file to get started)
    - Alternatively, you can preview a Webspace with a 3D model hosted anywhere on the Web (and you’ve got access to) (just paste the URL to the 3D model into the input field)
    - Note that the 3D model needs to be stored or hosted as a glb file (ending of the file “.glb”) for the preview to work
### Log in
- Ready to properly use the OIM app and own your own personal Webspaces?
- To create and own Webspaces, you need to log in
- OIM offers several alternatives to do so
  - Plug
    - This is a browser extension which also serves as a crypto wallet on the Internet Computer blockchain platform (which OIM is built upon)
    - Please install the extension in your browser (if you click on Login and then Plug, you should be taken to where you can install it)
    - Make sure it is enabled for the OIM page (should be by default)
    - With the browser extension installed and enabled, click on Login and then Plug and a Plug popup should show up prompting you to log in
    - Afterwards, the popup will ask you to confirm logging into the OIM app (and shows you which other software on the Internet Computer OIM is using for extra transparency)
    - Confirm and you will be logged into the OIM app via Plug
  - Stoic wallet
    - This is another wallet on the Internet Computer blockchain platform
    - To use it, you will need to create an account (your personal wallet) with them first
    - Click on Login and then Stoic to be taken to the Webpage where you can create your Stoic account
    - Create a Stoic account and come back to the OIM app
    - Click on Login and then Stoic, and in a new tab Stoic will ask you to confirm your login to the OIM app
    - Confirm and you will be logged into the OIM app via Stoic
### After you’re logged in
- Triumph, you’re logged into the OIM app! Can you feel how close you are to owning your personal Webspace and designing it the way you want to?
- To create your personal Webspace (3D Webpage), go to the “Create” tab
  - There, you’ve got several options to create a Webspace
  - For each of them, you can first preview how the Webspace would look once created and then confirm the creation
  - There are several Webspaces we designed for you (e.g. space-themed “Your Web Space Station”, nature-themed “Your Nature Retreat” and island-themed “Your Internet Island”) which are ready for you to create right away and make them your personal Webspace
    - After looking at them (you can view them in fullscreen mode via the icon in the bottom-right corner in the preview), choose which one you like best
    - Then, click on “Create This Space!” to get a personal Webspace that looks just like it
    - Note that you can create multiple Webspaces
  - If you like to start with an existing 3D model, then we’ve got you covered
    - You can first preview a Webspace with a 3D model you have on your device (just click on “Choose File” to select the 3D model file to get started) and then create the Webspace with your 3D model if you like it (just click “Create This Space!” which appears under the preview of the selected file)
    - Alternatively, you can first preview a Webspace with a 3D model hosted anywhere on the Web (and you’ve got access to) (just paste the URL to the 3D model into the input field) and then create the Webspace with your 3D model if you like it (just click “Create This Space!” which appears under the preview of the pasted URL)
    - Note that the 3D model needs to be stored or hosted as a glb file (ending of the file “.glb”) for the preview (and creation) to work
- Let’s Go! You’ve got yourself your first personal Webspace! Welcome to the OIM community and welcome to the 3D Web!
- You can view your Webspaces under the “My Spaces” tab
  - Click on “My Spaces” and you’ll be taken to a section that lists all the Webspaces you own
  - You can see some details there for each Webspace
  - But most importantly, you can visit the Webspace! Just click on View and the Webspace will open in another tab
- Visit your Webspace (or any other Webspace)
  - Each Webspace is a 3D Webpage and has its own, unique URL
  - You can visit the Webspace by browsing to that URL in your browser
  - You can also share the URL for others to visit the Webspace (they just need to open the URL in their browser)
  - If you are the owner of the Webspace, you’ll have more options what you can do with the Webspace compared to other visitors
  - To see these options (as owner or as visitor), make sure you're logged in
  - As the Webspace’s owner you can
    - Do everything a visitor can do too
    - Edit the Webspace

      - Change how items in the Webspace look
        - E.g. an item’s position, size, angle
        - Advanced options like styling for some items
      - Make sure to hit the Save button after you’re done editing for your changes to be saved (and everyone else to then see when they visit your Webspace)
    - Create your Virtual Neighborhood
      - As owner, you can add virtual neighbors to your Webspace
      - These are other Webspaces (or any Webpage really) which is then connected to your Webspace
      - Visitors can see these connected virtual neighbors in the list but also in the Webspaces directly (click on the left-bottom corner button “Open Menu” and on “Load Neighbors” there for them to be visualized)
    - Edit the Webspace’s info
      - You can update the info about your Webspace
      - This includes its name, description and also some info about you as its owner
      - Visitors can also see this info
  - As a Webspace’s visitor you can
    - Enjoy the Webspace, move around in it and explore it
    - Discover the Webspace’s Virtual Neighborhood
      - As a list of Neighbors
      - Within the Webspace by clicking on the left-bottom corner button “Open Menu” and on “Load Neighbors” there for the neighbors to be visualized
