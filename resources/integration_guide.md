# Open Internet Metaverse Integration Guide

## Thank you for being interested in integrating with the Open Internet Metaverse!

## Some background maybe
- Webspaces in the Open Internet Metaverse (OIM) are 3D Webpages
- They are hosted on the Internet Computer blockchain platform
- Like other Webpages, they can be displayed in regular Web browsers via their unique URL

## How might you integrate it?
- Via its URL, you can link to the Webspace
- You can also embed it in your Webpage or application
- If you offer users a 3D experience as well, you could visualize the Webspace as part of it and make it easy for users to navigate between your experience and the Webspace
- Your Webpage could become a Virtual Neighbor to the Webspace (created within the OIM app)
  - You might want to include a similar feature like the Virtual Neighborhood in your application as well and make it compatible with OIM
  - Note that OIM uses Bebb Protocol to connect Virtual Neighbors (Bebb Protocol is an open network, so you could use it too)
  - We could incorporate special transitions or visualizations of each othersâ€™ Webpages/Webspaces as part of the compatible Virtual Neighborhood

## Welcome to the Open Internet Metaverse!
